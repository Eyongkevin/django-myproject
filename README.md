# DJANGO WEB DEVELOPMENT
This repo and its contents are for educational purposes taken from the book `Django 3 Web Development Cookbook Actionable Solutions to common problems in Python web development by Aidas Bendoraitis, Jake Kronika
`

I aim at using the techniques learned here to advance my knowledge on Python Web Development with Django. Ofcouse, some aspects will be chanced throughout the chapters of the above mentioned book base on my own experience.

## What are we building
The book doesn't uncover what we will be building. But with time, as I advance, I'll have a clear picture of the final product and update this section.

## Sections
This project will be divided into sections based on the chapters of the book. Each chapter of the book will be considered a section and will be tagged accordingly.

### Tag1: V1: Getting Started with Django 3.0
Here, we address configurations, settings, project file structure, database and many more.
